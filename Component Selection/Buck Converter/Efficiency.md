## Efficiency of the Buck Converter

The efficiency of the converter can be calculated using the losses in the components calculated earlier. The converter efficiency resulted in 0.748, and the following equations were used:

$$
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{inductor}} + P_{\text{mosfet}} + P_{\text{diode}} + P_{\text{capacitor}}
$$

$$
\eta = \frac{P_o}{P_o + P_{\text{total}}}
$$
