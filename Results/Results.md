# Results

This section presents measurements of the switched-mode power supply (SMPS) taken with an oscilloscope. Following that, a discussion section will analyze the results. The measurements were made with a 50-ohm load on the power supply.

## Discussion

The waveforms of the rectifier were exactly as expected. The grid had an RMS voltage of approximately 130V, which was within the expected range, with a frequency of approximately 60 Hz, which is correct for Brazil.

The voltage across the diode behaved as anticipated, conducting during one half-cycle of the sine wave, while being blocked during the other half-cycle.

The rectifier output voltage exhibited a ripple of 5.85%, slightly higher than the design target of 5%. The ripple was calculated by observing only the image of Vx, which shows a different maximum voltage compared to the maximum voltage in the Vin image, likely due to the oscilloscopeâ€™s timebase settings during the measurements.

$$ \text{Ripple} = \left( \frac{V_{\text{ripple}}}{V_{\text{DC}}} \right) \times 100 $$

$$ V_{\text{ripple}} = V_{\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}} $$

$$ V_{\text{DC}} = \frac{V_{\text{max}} + V_{\text{min}}}{2} $$

In the Buck converter, the MOSFET voltage waveform matched expectations, showing that most of the time the MOSFET is not conducting. This is expected since the converter's gain is relatively small.

The diode voltage waveform exhibited the expected complementary behavior, with the diode conducting most of the time, as theorized, while the MOSFET is off.

The frequencies of these two waveforms closely match the value provided in the datasheet, which specifies a typical frequency of 66 kHz.

The waveform of the voltage across the inductor exhibited the correct shape: when the MOSFET is on, the inductor has a positive voltage, and when the MOSFET is off, the inductor exhibits a negative voltage. This is as expected based on the theory. What deviates from the standard is the frequency measurement, as it should match the frequency of the MOSFET and the diode.

This discrepancy is due to the on/off control method of the LNK306 IC, which causes the MOSFET to remain off for several cycles. As a result, the converter frequency is lower than 66 kHz during certain periods.

The output voltage of the power supply is measured at a mean value of 11.9V, which is very close to the designed value, with an average current of 0.238 A. This results in a power output of approximately 2.83 W, slightly less than the targeted 3 W. This discrepancy can be attributed to practical losses not accounted for in the theoretical calculations, such as losses in the PCB traces, cables, and the NTC resistor. Additionally, component tolerance and error factors may contribute to a higher actual power dissipation than what was calculated theoretically.

Although the IC exhibits some limitations in its control method, such as its on/off regulation, which affects the switching frequency, the power supply has still demonstrated satisfactory performance. The observed deviations, like the lower than expected frequency and minor ripple in the output voltage, do not significantly impact its overall functionality. The design could be improved by adding shunt resistors to measure currents across components, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system's performance and losses.
