# HADWARE

This session contains the hardware project files for the switch-mode power supply. The software used was Fusion 360. The files for download and images have been provided.

The objective was to design hardware that could be manufactured in a DIY manner, so the PCB contains larger pads and traces than would normally be necessary.

The method used for fabrication was the photographic method, which involves coating the copper board with photo-sensitive paint and transferring the circuit using ultraviolet light.

Below are images of the top and bottom layers of the PCB after fabrication. Unfortunately, the solder mask on the bottom layer had some defects, but it still served its purpose of facilitating the soldering process.
